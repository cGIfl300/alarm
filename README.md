## User case:
As a developer I needed a pomodoro timer, I didn't found any simply working for
free. Here is one now.

## Install:  

### Generic install:  

Python3 must be installed on your operating system. You can get it from
[The Python Foundation](https://www.python.org/).

Consider installing and use a virtualenv.  
To install the needed libs, just use:  
`python -m pip -r requirements.txt`

## Usage:
You can use `alarm.py`. Alarm uses tkinter, a GUI is required.
This is not a CLI tool.

## My own use:
I just installed the needed lib to my system python3 interpreter, I created a
shortcut to alarm on my favorite window manager. Thus, I just need to click on
it and enjoy.
